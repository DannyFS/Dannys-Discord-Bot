# Dannys-Discord-Bot
A simple multi purpose discord.py bot

Version Alpha 0.5.1

This is a discontinued project for these reasons:
- Discord expects all developers to switch to a slash command based bot by April 2022.
- Discord.py is discontinued and does not have discord's new intergrations features
- It would take a long time to switch from json to SQL for storing data
- Not verified due to a lack of popularity
- Only 1 developer (owner)

I honestly don't care what you do with my bot, just pls don't claim my work as yours :)

Thanks,

Danny
